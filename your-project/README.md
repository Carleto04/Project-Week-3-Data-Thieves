## Project Description

In the world we live today, climate change and species decline is a common or at least know topic to discuss. It is said that humans are destructive and affect not only other species but also Earth. In order to learn more about the issue, we decided to look at the facts and analyse how the human population affects Earth's temperature and how these affect non-human species.


## Questions & Hypotheses

- Q1. Have the threatened species, the human population and the temperature increased over the years?

- Q2. Is human growth affecting non-human populations and temperature?

- Q3. Are vertebrates,invertebrates and plants affected in a different manner?


- H1. Humans are related to the extinction of non-human population 

- H2. Temperature is related to the extinction of non-human population 

- H3. Vertebrates and invertebrates are affected differently, being the latter the most affected

- H4. Plants and animals are affected differently, being the plants the most affected

- H5. As the temperature varies, the ratio of the most affected non-human populations change


## Dataset
1. Animal Species - (https://www.iucnredlist.org/resources/summary-statistics)
2. Temperature - (https://climate.nasa.gov/vital-signs/global-temperature/)
3. Population - (https://databank.worldbank.org/)

## Workflow

The workflow followed was:

- Questions
- Hypotheses
- Dataset research
- Web scrapping + API requests
- Dataset enquiries
- Data cleaning
- Data analysis
- Results
- Conclusions

## Organization
How did you organize your work? Did you use any tools like a kanban board?

We used trello in order to organize our work and have a visual representation of the pendind tasks.
