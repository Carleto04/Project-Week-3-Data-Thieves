    "Humans where once fairly harmless and peaceful (minus some animal killing, and some human killing and well a lot of killing but yeah, you get the point) but then, somehow (ehem colonialism and industrial revolution) they became LETHAL!!! at least to many other species (we have always been lethal towards our own).\n",

    "Over the milenia Earth has experienced many cyclic changes including climate variation and its consequent temperature fluctuation (glacial advance and retreat). The end of last Ice Age allowed us to thrive so yeah to climate change!! But is this temperature change all part of Earth's plan? or are humans responsible for this? Climate change is very real and facts show that Earth's plan was not having all this tiny humans messing around. So, let us stop with all the babling and start seeing some facts.\n"

    "For this project, APIs and web scrapping were initially the main resources to obtain information. Nonetheless, API access was complicated and obtaining tokens proved to be a challange that could not be successfully completed. Web scrapping on the other hand, was very useful to gather initial data to have a general idea about what to do, but useless due to lack of common variables.  At the end, csv datasets were the main source of information.\n",

So, for the first hypothesis and the second one we can say that the data follows a similar increasing trend\n"
